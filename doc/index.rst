koine-nlp
=========

A library for common NLP-related tasks for Koine Greek.

The fullest use of the library comes in the normalize() function,
which combines all of the available methods to produce an end result
which is suitable for indexing. See the "Using koine-nlp" tutorial and
the full koinenlp API reference documentation for more.

koine-nlp requires only Python3 (or even Python 2.7) and its standard
libraries.
